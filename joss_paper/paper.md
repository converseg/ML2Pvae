# Summary

In educational measurement, Item Response Theory (IRT) aims to model the probability of a student answering a question (item) correctly as a function of the student's continuous latent ability (skill) values, along with parameters associated with the item itself such as the question difficulty. For example, the basic arithmetic question $3 \times 4 + 2$ requires skills "multiplication" and "addition". A popular IRT model, and the focus of the software `ML2Pvae`, is the Multidimensional Logistic 2-Parameter (ML2P) model, which gives the probability of student $j$ answering item $i$ correctly as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ml2p}
P(x_{ij} = 1 | \vec \theta_j; \vec a_i, b_i) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\sum_{k=1}^K a_{ik} \cdot \theta_{jk} + b_i\right)}
\end{equation}
where $\vec \theta_j =\{\theta_{jk}\}_{k=1}^K$ quantifies student $j$'s $K$ latent abilities, $a_{ik}$ determines \textit{how much} of skill $k$ is required for item $i$, and $b_i$ gives the difficulty of item $i$.

In large-scale assessments (e.g. standardized testing), it is a common goal for researchers to quantify the associated parameters, both to better measure each student's knowledge in various topics and determine the efficacy of each assessment item. Estimating the parameters $\vec \theta_j$, $\vec a_i$, and $b_i$ for all students $j$ and all items $i$ is a well-studied task, many of which involve some sort of Monte-Carlo method to evaluate integrals.

# Statement of need

Sofware like `mirt` [@mirt] is popular for estimating IRT parameters, but due to the curse of dimensionality, such methods experience difficulty or even infeasibility on assessments where the latent ability dimension is large, i.e. a large number ($>8$) of distinct latent skills are under assessment. Recent work has explored the use of a modified variational autoencoder (VAE), a type of neural network, to estimate parameters [@Curi:2019]. Further extensions generalize ML2P-VAE method to correlated latent abilities and directly compare the method with popular `mirt` models [@Converse:2021].

The `ML2Pvae` package for `R` [@R] provides IRT practitioners with easy-to-use functions construct, train, and evaluate VAE models for parameter estimation without requiring background knowledge of neural networks or TensorFlow [@tensorflow]. Additionall, `ML2Pvae` also includes the capability to fit a VAE to a more general multivariate Gaussian latent distribution with non-identity covariance matrix. This novel neural network architecture implementation could be useful to researchers in other applications outside of educational measurement.

# Implementation

The correlated VAE implementation is worth explaining a bit here

# Mathematics
This isn't an actual section. Equations use inline dollar signs like this $x+1$.

Use double-dollar signs for self-standing equations:

$$ P(u_{ij} = 1) = f(\theta)$$

Or can use LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:my_eq}
f(x) = x^2
\end{equation}
